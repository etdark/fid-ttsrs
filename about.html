                TTS (Text to speech) is a system which will convert text into speech which will help content creators,office 
                workers, students and for some people with disabilities (especially blind people). Speech recognition is a 
                system which will detect specific language sound and convert it into text which also useful for content creators,
                students, office workers and for some people with disabilities (especially deaf peoples). The main reason that 
                motivates us to make this project is because of there is no satisfying TTS and speech recognition system for Amharic
                language, which is very helpful for Ethiopian people. In which it specifically helps them in their workstation, schools,
                universities and offices. Also, our project motivates and promotes other Ethiopian local languages.
